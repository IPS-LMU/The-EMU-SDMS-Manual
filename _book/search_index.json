Further, we assume the reader has a grasp of the basic concepts of the R language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. For readers new to R, there are multiple, freely available R tutorials online (e.g., Statistical Analysis: an Introduction using R/R_basics. R also has a set of very detailed manuals and tutorials that come preinstalled with R. To be able to access R’s own “An Introduction to R” introduction, simply type help.start() into the R console and click on the link to the tutorial. 1.1 Installing the EMU-SDMS (copy and pasted from EMU manual) 1.) R Download the R programming language from http://www.cran.r-project.org Install the R programming language by executing the downloaded file and following the on-screen instructions. 2.) emuR Start up R. Enter install.packages(&quot;emuR&quot;) after the &gt; prompt to install the package. (You will only need to repeat this if package updates become available.) As the wrassp package is a dependency of the emuR package, it does not have to be installed separately. 3.) EMU-webApp (prerequisite) The only thing needed to use the EMU-webApp is a current HTML5 compatible browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Opera/…). However, as most of the development and testing is done using Chrome we recommend using it, as it is by far the best tested browser. 1.2 Installing additional R-packages that are used throughout this course ggplot2 for visualization purposes: install.packages(&quot;emuR&quot;) dplyr for data manipulation: install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;) "]
